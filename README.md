## Key Concepts

Binary Search (二分查找)
: Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

Linear Search (简单查找)
: Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. A sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

Bucket (桶)
: You can treat a bucket as an element of an array, as a cell, or as a space where something can live.

Linear time (线性时间)
: In linear time algorithms every single element in the input is visited once. As the input size grows our algorithm's run time grows exactly with the size of the input.

Logarithmic time (对数时间)
: A logarithmic algorithm splits a list or other data structure into smaller pieces every time it runs.

Factorial time (阶乘时间)
: An algorithm is said to have a factorial time complexity when it grows in a factorial way based on the size of the input data.

Big O representation (大O表示法)
: We use big-O notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below.

| Big O representation | Common algorithms |
|:---:|:---:|
| O(log *n*) | Binary Search |
| O(*n*) | Simple Search |
| O(*n* * log *n*) | Quick Search |
| O(*n^2*) | Selection Search |
| O(*n*!) | Travel Agent |
